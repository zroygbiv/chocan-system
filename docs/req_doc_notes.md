# Miles' Chocoholics Anonymous Requirements Document Notes

This is basically just ```requirements_template.doc```  rewritten as plaintext. Feel free to edit it or just use it as an additional reference. I'm going to continue to add to it. Also feel free to delete, move, or rewrite anything I wrote that is poorly worded, irrelevant, or incorrect. 

I wrote the original prompts as *italics*.
